# Model Switching Guide: GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini

## Current Model: GPT-4o ‚úÖ

Your backend is currently using **GPT-4o** (the best model for quality).

---

## Why Switch Models?

| Model | Cost per Analysis | Quality | Speed | Best For |
|-------|-------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **GPT-4o** | ~$0.01 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Best | Fast | Production |
| **GPT-4o-mini** | ~$0.001 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Great | Faster | Testing, Cost savings |

**Cost Difference:** GPT-4o-mini is **10x cheaper!**

---

## When to Use Each Model

### Use GPT-4o (Current) When:
- ‚úÖ Launching to real users
- ‚úÖ You want the best quality analysis
- ‚úÖ Budget allows ~$0.01 per analysis
- ‚úÖ Users are paying $4.99/month for premium

### Use GPT-4o-mini When:
- ‚úÖ Testing and development
- ‚úÖ Budget is tight
- ‚úÖ Volume is very high (10,000+ analyses/month)
- ‚úÖ Quality is "good enough" (it's still very good!)

## How to Switch Models

### Option 1: Switch to GPT-4o-mini (Save Money)

**Edit this file:**
```
functions/src/index.ts
```

**Change line 15 from:**
```typescript
const OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o"; // Current
```

**To:**
```typescript
const OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"; // 10x cheaper!
```

**Then redeploy:**
```bash
cd /Users/joannacholas/CursorProjects/odyseya
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete.

### Option 2: Switch Back to GPT-4o (Best Quality)

**Edit this file:**
```
functions/src/index.ts
```

**Change line 15 from:**
```typescript
const OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini";
```

**Back to:**
```typescript
const OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o";
```

**Then redeploy:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Recommended Strategy

### For Testing (Now)
Use **GPT-4o** since you already have Tier 1 unlocked:
- You have 500 RPM capacity
- Testing costs are minimal
- Get to experience best quality

### For Production Launch
**Start with GPT-4o**, monitor costs:
- If costs are manageable ‚Üí Keep GPT-4o ‚úÖ
- If costs too high ‚Üí Switch to GPT-4o-mini

### For Scale (1,000+ users)
**Switch to GPT-4o-mini**:
- Savings add up quickly at scale
- Quality is still great
- Users won't notice much difference

---

## Both Models Support

‚úÖ **All features work identically:**
- Subscription tiers (5/month free, unlimited premium)
- Rate limiting (10/hour free, 60/hour premium)
- Usage tracking
- Error handling
- Security (API key protection)

‚úÖ **Same response format:**
- Same JSON structure
- Same fields (emotionalTone, triggers, etc.)
- Same integration with Flutter app

‚úÖ **No app changes needed:**
- Backend handles model switching
- Flutter app works the same
- Users see no difference in UI

---

## Current Configuration

**File:** `functions/src/index.ts`
**Line 15:**
```typescript
const OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o";
```

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Yes
**Active Model:** GPT-4o
**Cost per Analysis:** ~$0.01

## Testing Model Quality

Want to compare models yourself?

### Step 1: Test with GPT-4o (Current)
1. Create a journal entry
2. Save the AI analysis
3. Note the insights, detail level, accuracy

### Step 2: Switch to GPT-4o-mini
```bash
# Edit functions/src/index.ts, change line 15 to:
# const OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini";

firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Step 3: Test with GPT-4o-mini
1. Create similar journal entry
2. Compare the AI analysis
3. Decide which model is worth the cost

### Step 4: Choose Your Model
- **GPT-4o:** Best quality, worth it for premium users
- **GPT-4o-mini:** Great quality, 10x cheaper, perfect for free tier

## Summary

You have **full control** over which model to use:

1. **Currently using:** GPT-4o ‚úÖ
2. **Cost:** ~$0.01 per analysis
3. **To save money:** Switch to GPT-4o-mini (10x cheaper)
4. **Switch time:** 5 minutes (edit + redeploy)
5. **No app changes:** Backend handles everything

**My recommendation:**
- **Now (testing):** Keep GPT-4o (you have $5-10 credits)
- **At 100+ users:** Consider GPT-4o-mini
- **Premium tier:** Always use GPT-4o (justify $4.99/month)
- **Free tier:** Could use GPT-4o-mini to save costs
