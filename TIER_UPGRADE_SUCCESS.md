|--------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Tokens/Min** | 10,000 TPM | 90,000 TPM | **9x faster** |

## 🚀 What This Means

### Before (Free Tier)
- ❌ Only 3 requests per minute (1 every 20 seconds)
- ❌ Would fail with just 4 simultaneous users
- ❌ Not suitable for production

### Now (Tier 1)
- ✅ **500 requests per minute**
- ✅ Can handle **hundreds of simultaneous users**
- ✅ **10,000 requests per day**
- ✅ **PRODUCTION READY!**

---

## 📊 Real-World Capacity

### What 500 RPM Means

**Simultaneous Users:**
- If each analysis takes 2 seconds
- You can handle: **500 requests/min ÷ 2 = 250 concurrent users**

**Daily Capacity:**
- 10,000 requests/day
- At 5 analyses per user (free tier)
- **= 2,000 free users per day**

### Cost at Full Capacity

**10,000 analyses per day:**
- Cost: 10,000 × $0.01 = **$100/day**
- Monthly: **~$3,000/month**

**Realistic usage (100 analyses/day):**
- Cost: 100 × $0.01 = **$1/day**
- Monthly: **~$30/month**

**Your $5-10 credits:**
- Covers: 500-1000 analyses
- Plenty for testing and initial users!

## 🎯 Testing Plan (Next 30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Test User (5 min)

Firebase Console → Firestore:
```
Collection: users
Document ID: [your Firebase Auth user ID]
Fields:
  isPremium: false
  email: "your-email@example.com"
  createdAt: [now]
```

### Step 2: Test App (10 min)

```bash
cd /Users/joannacholas/CursorProjects/odyseya
flutter run
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Sign in with your account
2. Create a voice journal entry
3. Wait for AI analysis to appear
4. Create 2-3 more entries quickly (test rate limits)
5. Verify all analyses complete successfully

### Step 3: Verify Backend (5 min)

**Firebase Console → Functions → Logs:**
- Look for: "✅ Analysis completed for [userId]"
- Check for any errors
- Verify tokens used per request

**Firebase Console → Firestore:**
- Go to: `users/{yourUserId}/usage/2025-10`
- Verify: `analysesCount` increments correctly
- Check: `month` field is "2025-10"

### Step 4: Test Free Tier Limit (5 min)

Create **6 journal entries total** (you should have 3 already):
- Entries 1-5: Should work fine ✅
- Entry 6: Should fail with "Monthly limit reached" ❌
- Verify upgrade prompt appears

**To reset for more testing:**
- Delete the usage document: `users/{userId}/usage/2025-10`
- OR set `isPremium: true` in user document

## 💰 Monitor Your Spending

### Check OpenAI Usage

https://platform.openai.com/usage

**What to watch:**
- Tokens used per request (~1000 tokens = $0.01)
- Daily cost
- Remaining credits

### Set Budget Alerts (Do This Now!)

https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Soft limit:** $10/month (warning email)
- **Hard limit:** $20-50/month (stops all requests)

This protects you from surprise bills!

## 🔒 Security Reminder

Your API key is **still secure**:
- ✅ Stored server-side in Firebase
- ✅ Never exposed to Flutter app
- ✅ Cannot be extracted by users
- ✅ Rate limits prevent abuse

Even with Tier 1 limits, the backend still enforces:
- Free users: 5 analyses/month
- Premium users: Unlimited (but still 500 RPM max)
- Rate limiting: 10/hour free, 60/hour premium
